            <h2>Power Bodybuilding</h2>
            <img src="Images/titan.jpeg" alt="Powerbodybuilding">
            <p class="training-description">The trick is to train based around heavy compound movements. These being your Bench Press, Squat and Deadlift. In these movements, you lift as heavy as possible, we’re talking superhuman lifts, pushing yourself to the absolute limit. After those movements, we then switch to hypertrophy sets and rep ranges for other exercises across a 5 day training split. After training like this, as I have done personally, I can guarantee you’ll be stronger, fuller and more muscular than ever before.</p>
