                <p class="description">Created by legendary pro bodybuilder and six-time Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates, Blood & Guts is a classic, aggressive bodybuilding program for maximizing muscle growth. This six-week plan is built on Dorian's signature training style: high-intensity training, or HIT. And to demonstrate, he enlists renowned trainer and bodybuilder Kris Gethin as the victim. </p>
                <h2>Program Overview</h2>
                <p class="overview">
                    <h3>Learn high-intensity training from the master.</h3>
                    <h4>4 workouts per week / 45-60 min. workouts</h4>
                    <p>We're not talking about high-intensity interval training! HIT with one "I" is the muscle growth protocol Dorian Yates used to 
                        build his legendary bodybuilder physique and hold the Mr. Olympia title against all comers. 
                        We're not talking about high-intensity interval training! HIT with one "I" is the muscle growth protocol Dorian Yates used to build his legendary bodybuilder physique and hold the Mr. Olympia title against all comers. Instead of racking up volume, you'll take one working set far beyond failure with extreme techniques like partial reps and extra negatives. If you've never tried HIT bodybuilding before, it'll shock your muscles into growth like nothing else.
